How experiments can be conducted with ML models on open source data


Automated machine learning has been a growing trend for the past few years. The introduction of more open source frameworks has made this possible. Some dataset topics are too complex for non-experts to tackle to develop a complete  end to end ML solution. Yet the  dataset often contains enough data to develop a supervised machine learning model for classification or regression. These notebook examples show the application of Auto ML to healthcare and Pharma data that may require domain expertise.

Additional files, such as CORS and Canvas data prep, are included for running the same ML experiment on the AWS cloud without any python code. Sagemaker Canvas is their no code option for ML model development.

With the model development demonstration, through the python framework application , the hope is that more complex datasets generated by the Covid pandemic can be easily modeled.  The recent literature shows an example where a Machine learning model with the largest US COVID-19 dataset can predict disease severity.
